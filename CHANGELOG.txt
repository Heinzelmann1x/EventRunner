-Fixed error in central/access property introduced by "definition time trigger" below.
-(Fixed errors where trigger rules were not run at definition time.) REVERTED for now.
 E.g. Rule.eval("5:isOff => log('x')") would not trigger if 5 was already off when rule defined and only trigger the first time that 5 changed value. This was also true for the 'for' construct.
-More effective lookup of 'property' and 'global' triggers
-Built-in support for 'ping'
 {type=Event.PING} => Event.postRemote(sender,{type=Event.PONG})
 Event.PING == '%%PING%%'
 Event.PONG == '%%PONG%%'
-Better handling of HomeTable struct when running offline
 If _deviceTable is defined then fibaro:getGlobal(_deviceTable) results in _deviceTable..".data" is read in from a file in the working directory.
 This means that it is possible to have many device data files
-Support for Event.trueFor(time,event,action)
 Only works with with 'property' and 'global' events and require the 'value' field to have a constraint.
 Ex. Event.trueFor("+/00:10",{type='property',deviceID=8, value='$>0},
                    function(env) Log(LOG.LOG,"Device 8 have been on for 10min") end)
  This works because we can create a "negative" event pattern for these kind of events.
